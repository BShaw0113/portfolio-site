          <h3>Tower Overhaul Project — DHL Supply Chain</h3>

          <p class="project-summary">
            Led an analytical initiative during my Systems Analyst internship to address
            critical inventory storage and tower management challenges.
          </p>

          <div class="project-more">
            <p>
              During my internship at DHL Supply Chain, I identified inefficiencies in inventory
              storage and tower utilization that were contributing to operational bottlenecks
              and increased costs.
            </p>

            <p>
              I conducted a comprehensive analysis of inventory workflows, system usage,
              and data accuracy, producing a detailed report outlining root causes,
              operational risks, and financial impact.
            </p>

            <p>
              Findings and proposed solutions were presented to senior management, with
              projected cost savings exceeding <strong>$10 million</strong> through improved
              inventory organization, system usage, and process optimization.
